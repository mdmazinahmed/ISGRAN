# ESRGAN Model Interpolation for Image Super-Resolution

This project presents a novel approach to image super-resolution through interpolated SRGAN models, offering a flexible solution for balancing pixel accuracy and perceptual quality in image upscaling tasks.

## üìë Abstract

This research introduces a comprehensive study on Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) for image upscaling, with a novel focus on interpolated models. We implement and evaluate several SRGAN models, including the PSNR-oriented model, ESRGAN, and two interpolated models with Œ± values of 0.5 and 0.8. Our study demonstrates that while PSNR-oriented models achieve higher pixel-wise accuracy and ESRGAN models produce better perceptual quality, interpolated models offer a flexible middle ground, providing practical solutions for various application domains.

## üåü Key Features

- Novel interpolation technique between PSNR and ESRGAN architectures
- Flexible Œ± parameter control (implemented for 0.5 and 0.8)
- Comprehensive evaluation using PSNR and SSIM metrics
- Batch processing capability
- Real-time visualization of results

## üìä Research Findings

Our experimental results show distinct characteristics for each model type:

| Model Type | Characteristics | Best Use Case |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| PSNR-oriented | Highest pixel-wise accuracy, smoother textures | Medical imaging, scientific visualization |
| ESRGAN | Superior perceptual quality, better detail preservation | Entertainment, artistic applications |
| Interpolated (Œ±=0.5) | Balanced performance, reduced artifacts | General-purpose upscaling |
| Interpolated (Œ±=0.8) | Enhanced perceptual quality while maintaining accuracy | Photography, professional media |

## üìà Comparative Analysis

Detailed performance metrics from our research:

| Model | PSNR (dB) | SSIM | Key Characteristics |
|-------|-----------|------|---------------------|
| PSNR-oriented | ~30 | ~0.89 | Higher pixel accuracy, smoother textures |
| ESRGAN | ~27 | ~0.85 | Better perceptual quality, enhanced details |
| Interpolated (0.5) | ~28.5 | ~0.87 | Balanced performance |
| Interpolated (0.8) | ~27.5 | ~0.86 | Enhanced perception with accuracy |

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Model Architecture
The project implements the RRDB (Residual-in-Residual Dense Block) architecture with:
- 23 RRDB blocks
- 64 base features
- 32 growth channels
- 4x upscaling factor

### Interpolation Technique
Our novel interpolation approach combines model weights using:
```python
net_interp = (1 - Œ±) * net_PSNR + Œ± * net_ESRGAN
```
where Œ± controls the balance between PSNR and ESRGAN characteristics.

## üéØ Applications

Our research findings suggest optimal use cases for different models:

1. **Medical Imaging**: PSNR-oriented model for accurate detail preservation
2. **Entertainment Media**: ESRGAN for enhanced visual quality
3. **Professional Photography**: Interpolated models (Œ±=0.5-0.8) for balanced results
4. **Scientific Visualization**: PSNR-oriented or low-Œ± interpolated models
